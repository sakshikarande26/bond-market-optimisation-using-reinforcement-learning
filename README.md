# Bond Market Optimisation Using Reinforcement Learning

This project explores the use of reinforcement learning to optimize strategies in the bond market. By leveraging RL algorithms, the model learns to make intelligent trading decisions, aiming to maximize returns and manage risk in a dynamic market environment.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares bond market data for training.
- **Reinforcement Learning Model:** Utilizes RL agents to learn market behaviors and optimize trading strategies.
- **Evaluation & Visualization:** Tracks and visualizes performance metrics and trading outcomes.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Cumulative Return:** Measures the total return generated by the RL agent over the test period.
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Evaluates risk-adjusted returns, showing the trade-off between risk and reward.
- **Max Drawdown:** Indicates the largest observed loss from a peak to a trough during evaluation.

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading:** Loads bond market data from CSV or other sources.
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleans and structures data for RL agent consumption.
3. **Model Training:** Trains a reinforcement learning agent on historical market data.
4. **Prediction & Evaluation:** Simulates trading, evaluates results using financial metrics.
5. **Visualization:** Plots and saves performance and trading actions for analysis.

## Usage

Run the provided scripts or notebooks in your preferred Python environment. Make sure to place your bond market data file in the appropriate directory.
